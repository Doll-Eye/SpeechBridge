# SpeechBridge installer: makes every game in the CrossOver bottle speak through the Mac.
#
# Safe to run any time, as often as you like — after installing a game, and after a Steam
# "verify integrity" (which puts a game's original speech plugins back). It only copies
# files; nothing is run inside the bottle. What it does, per game under steamapps/common:
#
#   nvdaControllerClient.dll present  -> replaced by the NVDA stand-in (original kept as .orig)
#   (also the 64/32-suffixed names Tolk uses, e.g. inside Stardew Access's screen-reader-libs)
#   WindowsTTS.dll present            -> replaced by the WindowsTTS stand-in (original kept)
#   Tolk.dll present                  -> SAAPI64.dll / SAAPI32.dll placed beside it
#   Diablo IV                         -> nothing in its folder; SAAPI64 is served from system32
#
# and once for the bottle: the SapiBridge voice DLLs are copied to C:\SpeechBridge. Their
# registration (regsvr32, from inside the bottle) is a one-off and is checked here, not done —
# see README, "SapiBridge".
#
# Usage:  SpeechBridge/install.sh [bottle-name]      default bottle: Steam
#         SpeechBridge/install.sh --uninstall [bottle-name]   put every .orig back
